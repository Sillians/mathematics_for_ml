## **The Vector Equation of a Plane**

A **plane** in three-dimensional space can be described using vectors. The **vector equation of a 
plane** expresses all the points $\mathbf{r}$ that lie on the plane using:


* A **point on the plane** $\mathbf{r}_0$
* Two **non-parallel vectors** $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$ that lie **in the plane**

### **1. General Vector Equation of a Plane**

If $\mathbf{r}_0$ is a point on the plane, and $\mathbf{v}_1$, $\mathbf{v}_2$ are two linearly independent vectors **in** the plane, then the vector equation of the plane is:

$$
\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_0 + s \mathbf{v}_1 + t \mathbf{v}_2
$$

Where:

* $\mathbf{r}$ is the **position vector** of any point on the plane
* $s, t \in \mathbb{R}$ are scalar parameters

### **2. Finding the Vector Equation of the Plane Perpendicular to a Given Vector**

If a plane is **perpendicular to a vector** $\mathbf{n}$, then $\mathbf{n}$ is the **normal vector** to the plane.

Let $\mathbf{r} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{r}_0 = \begin{bmatrix} x_0 \\ y_0 \\ z_0 \end{bmatrix}$ be a known point on the plane.

Then the plane satisfies:

$$
(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0) \cdot \mathbf{n} = 0
$$

This is the **scalar form**, which ensures every point $\mathbf{r}$ lies on the plane by being orthogonal to $\mathbf{n}$.

### **3. Finding a Vector That Is Parallel To a Plane**

A vector is **parallel to a plane** if it is **orthogonal to the plane's normal vector**.

Let $\mathbf{n}$ be the planeâ€™s normal vector. Then any vector $\mathbf{v}$ such that:

$$
\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n} = 0
$$

is **parallel to the plane**.

You can find such vectors by solving this dot product condition for $\mathbf{v}$.

### **4. Finding the Vector Equation of the Plane Perpendicular to a Given Straight Line**

If a plane is **perpendicular to a straight line**, then the direction vector of the line becomes the **normal vector** of the plane.

Let the line be given in vector form:

$$
\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_1 + t\mathbf{d}
$$

Where $\mathbf{d}$ is the **direction vector** of the line.

To find the vector equation of the plane **perpendicular** to this line and passing through a point $\mathbf{r}_0$:

* Use $\mathbf{d}$ as the normal vector $\mathbf{n}$
* The equation becomes:

$$
(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0) \cdot \mathbf{d} = 0
$$

Which is the scalar form of the plane.

You can also rewrite it in parametric/vector form by finding two vectors orthogonal to $\mathbf{d}$ and using them as the spanning vectors for the plane.
